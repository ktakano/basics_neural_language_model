# Short lecture on "Basics of Neural Language Model"
**Lecturer: Prof. Kosuke Takano, Kanagawa Institute of Technology**

This short lecture instructs the basics of neural language model along with simple python codes. The Large Language Model (LLM) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Goolge's Gemini are dramatically changing our life and society with their awesome human-like capability, however their mechanism is not so complicated. This lecture aims to focus on basic components to build the LLM and enlighten how they work in a neural network architecture. Student will write small codes of basic functions consisting of neural networks for the natural language processing and deepen the understanding on the principle.
